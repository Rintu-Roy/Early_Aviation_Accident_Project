# Early_Aviation_Accident_Project
 

- This project demonstrates an integrated workflow for aviation accident data analysis using Python, SQL Server, and Power BI.  

- Import and fetch aviation accident data in Python. Preprocess the data to clean and transform it into a format suitable for loading into SQL Server.

- Load the processed data into SQL Server tables using Python's SQLAlchemy ORM.

- Perform exploratory data analysis in Python using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries. Extract insights like total fatalities per year, aircraft models with the highest accidents, etc.

- Connect Power BI to the SQL Server database and create interactive dashboards and reports to visualize the key findings. Build charts, graphs, and tables to effectively convey the insights.

- Schedule and automate the data import, processing, and loading into SQL Server using Python scripts and Windows Task Scheduler.

- Host the project on GitHub with source code, SQL scripts, Power BI reports, and documentation. Follow best practices to organize the repository.

- Include detailed README files explaining the setup, installation requirements, usage, and execution instructions for the different components.

- This project showcases an automated end-to-end aviation accident data analysis and meaningful visualizations by integrating Python, SQL Server, and Power BI. It provides a practical workflow for data engineering and analytics.
